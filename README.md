A detailed classroom interior including desks, chairs, a screen, windows, and a teacherâ€™s podium.

An interactive door that opens and closes on click.
Hierarchical mesh structures and event handling implemented via Three.js for immersive interactivity.

Scope to extend with animated student and teacher avatars or IoT integrations.
